# Computation-Intelligence-Projects
These are the two projects I did for my Computation Intelligence class
### Project 1 
In the first project, we are given the MNIST dataset, and we first want to be able to cluster these numbers using the K-Means algorithm, in order to have a number classifier which has a high accuracy on the test set

For the second part of the project, we try the classification with a standard MLP, and then we compare it with the previous results we obtained

Finally, we are looking for a way to use neural networks in order to perform unsupervised clustering. After some research, I found that the most efficient neural network type in order to do this task. is the [self-organizing map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map) (AKA Kohonen map)
